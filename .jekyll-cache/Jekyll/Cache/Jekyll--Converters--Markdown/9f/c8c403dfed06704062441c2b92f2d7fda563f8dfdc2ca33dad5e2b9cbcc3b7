<h2 id="what-is-the-game-about">What is the game about?</h2>

<p>In this game you all turn into spies and try to decode secret messages given to you by your teamâ€™s spymaster ðŸ•µ. You divide into two teams, red and blue, and place 25 word cards in a 5x5 square. Each team appoints a spymaster, they will know which words belong to their teams and will have to hint their teams to guess them by giving them clues. Clues consist of one word and a number; the word is what the clue is and the number says how many words the clue refers to. All other teammates may discuss aloud what they think the clue could mean but the spymaster has to remain silent. Once they have their guesses they touch the cards they chose and see if they got it right. The objective is to correctly guess all of your teamsâ€™ words before the other team does and without touching one forbidden card â€“ the assassin.</p>

<h2 id="what-kind-of-vocabulary-can-you-practice">What kind of vocabulary can you practice?</h2>

<p>This game does not require you to use any sentences, only simple nouns. You can simplify the discussion part, for example by also only using nouns and body language (like in charades), this can make the game even more challenging and fun! The reason I classify this game as intermediate though is that it uses maaaany nouns â€“ there are 400 on the cards and thereâ€™s a limitless number of clue words that you can use! So you will most probably want to play it with your little translator app ðŸ—£ ready for action. And you can always up the level by making the discussion part more complex.</p>
