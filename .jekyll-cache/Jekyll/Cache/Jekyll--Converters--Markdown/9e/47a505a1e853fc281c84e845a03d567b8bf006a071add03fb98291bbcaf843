<p>VIRUS! is a dynamic and fun card game for between 2 and 6 players in which you must build a human body (it takes 4 organs, one of each colour) while trying to avoid your opponents from infecting it, destroying it,or stealing your organs. You can take as much time as you need to think about your strategy, but the faster you spread your illnesses, the better your games will be. Try and immunise your organs as soon as possible so that the other players cannot destroy them!</p>

<p>You will use sickness related vocabulary like infect, vaccine, medicine, immunise, stomach, heal, etc. It offers multiple difficulty levels when it comes to the vocabulary and structures; you can choose to: 
a) narrate your actions in in the present tense or, if you wish to make it more difficult, in the past tense
b) use medical jargon with Latin-based words (e.g. infekowac) or up the game using words with Slavic roots (e.g. zarazac).</p>

<p>Example sentences you will learn:</p>

<p>Infekuje/zarazam twoj zoladek wirusem.
Transplantuje/przeszczepiam twoje serce.
Moj mozg jest zaszczepiony.</p>
