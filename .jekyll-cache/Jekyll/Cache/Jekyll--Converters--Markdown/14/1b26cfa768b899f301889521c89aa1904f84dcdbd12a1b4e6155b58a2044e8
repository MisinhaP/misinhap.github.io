<h2 id="what-is-the-game-about">What is the game about?</h2>

<p>The objective of codenames is to correctly guess all of your teamsâ€™ code words on the board before the other team does and without guessing the assassin. This is possible because your Spymaster will give you a one-word clue and a number. Using this information and similar clues throughout the game your team will try to interpret the spymasterâ€™s clue and guess each code word.</p>

<p>The game needs the players to split into two even teams. One team claiming the blue agent cards and one team claiming the red agent cards. Each team should then appoint a spymaster, they will be the clue giver for the game.</p>

<p>The spymasters then should shuffle and deal out 25 codename cards</p>

<p>Clues consist of one word and a number; The word is what the clue is and should focus on the cards that belong to your team, while the number is for how many cards this clue alludes to. The number is used only for the spymaster to tell the guessers how many code words his clue refers to, and can not also be a part of the clue.</p>

<p>The next part of the game is guessing the cards that go along with your spymasterâ€™s clues. All other teammates may discuss on what they think the clue could mean. Once they have their guesses they may start locking them in, and this happens when a teammate touches a card. No changes can be made once a card has been touched.</p>

<h2 id="what-kind-of-vocabulary-can-you-practice">What kind of vocabulary can you practice?</h2>

<p>This game is called The Mind for a reason â€“ it is played in the playersâ€™ minds, they cannot exchange any information about their cards or strategy. This makes it a very exciting, language independent game great for beginners as they can focus entirely on practicing their numbers (read the numbers and levels that appear on the table) and general gaming vocabulary (download the free Useful phrases in Polish PDF).</p>
