<h2 id="what-is-the-game-about">What is the game about?</h2>

<p>Hanabi is a cooperative game in which all the players prepare a spectacular fireworks show designed in 5 different colors – and each color needs to be arranged in the ascending 1-2-3-4-5 sequence. The trick? Players cannot see their own hand cards and need the advice of their fellow players! <br /></p>

<p>The more cards the players play correctly, the more points they receive when the game ends.</p>

<p>The player chooses a color and indicates to his/her teammate which of their hand cards match the chosen color by pointing at the cards. Important: The player must indicate all cards of that color in their teammate’s hand!</p>

<p>Example: “You have two yellow cards, here and here”. Indicating that a player has no cards of a particular color is allowed!</p>

<p>Example: “You have no blue cards”.</p>

<p>Value Hint
The player chooses a number value and gives a teammate a hint in the exact same fashion as a Color Hint.</p>

<p>Example: “You have a 5, here”.</p>

<p>Example: “You have no Twos”</p>

<p>By playing out cards the fireworks are created in the middle of the table. The player takes one card from his hand and places it face up in the middle of the table. Two things can happen:</p>

<p>The card can be played correctly
The player places the card face up so that it extends a current firework or starts a new firework.</p>

<p>The card cannot be played correctly
The gods are angry with this error and send a flash from the sky. The player turns a Storm tile lightning-side-up. The incorrect card is discarded to the discard pile near the draw deck.</p>

<p>Important: For the basic game, the colorful fireworks cards and the spare Note token(s) are not needed. They only come in to use for the advanced game.</p>

<h2 id="what-kind-of-vocabulary-can-you-practice">What kind of vocabulary can you practice?</h2>

<p>This game is called The Mind for a reason – it is played in the players’ minds, they cannot exchange any information about their cards or strategy. This makes it a very exciting, language independent game great for beginners as they can focus entirely on practicing their numbers (read the numbers and levels that appear on the table) and general gaming vocabulary (download the free Useful phrases in Polish PDF).</p>
