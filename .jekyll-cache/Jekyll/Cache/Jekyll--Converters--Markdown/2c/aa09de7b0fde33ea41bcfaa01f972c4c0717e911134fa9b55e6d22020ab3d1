<h2 id="what-is-the-game-about">What is the game about?</h2>

<p>All players form a single team. In the first round (level 1) each player receives 1 card, in the second round (level 2) they receive 2 cards, and so on. The only thing the players need to do as a team is lay all these cards down in numerical order, from lowest to highest. This would be super easy except that it is damn difficult! ðŸ˜± Here is the trick: the players must not disclose anything about their own cards - no sharing of information, no secret signals. Whoever thinks they have the next card simply puts it down â€“ if they were right and no one has a lower card, they continue playing but if they were wrong, everybody loses a life and you start the round again. The game ends when either the team has run out of lives (a loss) or has completed the last level (a victory).</p>

<p>Another helpful tool are the throwing stars.  You start with 1 of these, but you can earn additional ones by completing levels 2, 5, and 8.  To use one, a player interrupts play and suggests the use of a throwing star. If there is agreement around the table, players each play their lowest card face up.  Everybody syncs, and gameplay continues.  This is exceptionally helpful: not only does it get cards out of the game, but it also can give you significant information about what your fellow players hold.</p>
