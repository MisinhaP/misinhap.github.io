I"A<p>###Why does it work?</p>

<p>Because it forces you to start speaking. Now. Unprepared. With mistakes. Just say it and move your pawn cause it’s my turn now and I want to invade your town and get more points! You are learning to use Polish for accomplishing some goals and that is possibly the most important lesson you can get in the early phases of learning a language. If you are interested in learning more about what games do to our learning process,<a href="https://www.google.com">read this article</a>.</p>

<p>###How does it work?</p>

<p>You may wonder how learning how to say <em>I’m transplanting your brain</em> or <em>I’ve built a castle next to your river</em> can possibly be useful in learning how to communicate in Polish with your parents-in-law. But wait, didn’t you say studying grammar was boring? So just let it sneak in to your brain while you’re having fun transplanting brains and building castles. You’re a perfect structure decoding machine, just let your mind do the job. And <strong>learn words</strong> – games create a meaningful context to learn and practice new vocabulary and expressions that you can then use in your everyday communication.</p>

<p>###Take it step by step</p>

<p><strong>Keep your expectations realistic</strong> – learning a language takes a lot of time and practice and you will not learn it all playing 3 games. But each game brings you closer to your goal and offers some new, valuable insights!</p>

<p>###What games to play</p>

<p>Not every game will do the job, they need to meet some requirements to be useful for language learning for beginners/intermediate learners. But don’t worry, I’m here to help! I hand-picked some games that are both fun to play and can teach you a variety of language skills and vocabulary.</p>

<p>In my game descriptions you can find information about the kind of vocabulary you can expect to learn in each game <i class="fa fa-2x fa-commenting-o fa-fw wow bounceIn text-primary" aria-hidden="true"></i> and the language level you need to be able to play <i class="fa fa-2x fa-sort-amount-asc fa-fw wow bounceIn text-primary" aria-hidden="true"></i> – if you only need to say single words, it is for beginners and the longer the phrases get, the more advanced it is.</p>

<p>###Most important</p>

<p>You just play the game the way it’s supposed to be played but all the players need to loudly say what they’re doing in each move - this is when most of</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-game-about">What is the game about?</h2>

<p>VIRUS! is a dynamic and fun card game for between 2 and 6 players in which you must build  <strong>a human body</strong> (it takes <strong>4 organs</strong>, one of each colour) while trying to avoid your opponents from <strong>infecting it, destroying it, or stealing your organs</strong>. You can take as much time as you need to think about your strategy, but the faster you spread your illnesses, the more exciting your games will be. Try and <strong>immunise your organs</strong> as soon as possible so that the other players cannot destroy them!</p>
