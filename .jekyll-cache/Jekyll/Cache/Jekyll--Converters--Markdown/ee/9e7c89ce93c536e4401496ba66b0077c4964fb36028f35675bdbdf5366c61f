<h2 id="what-is-the-game-about">What is the game about?</h2>

<p>The gameâ€™s theme is inspired by the medieval French city of Carcassonne â€“ a stone fortress in the south of France known for its imposing fortifications. Players must develop the area around the city by placing landscape tiles with <strong>roads, cities, monasteries, fields and rivers</strong> and occupy the land with their followers â€“ cute wodden meeples (figurines) that turn into <strong>highwaymen, knights, monks and farmers</strong> depending on where they are placed on the board. You earn points by placing the figurines strategically, for example by claiming a road (1 point for each tile), a fortified city (1-4 points for each tile), a monastery (up to 9 points for a completed temple), etc. The point system might be somewhat confusing at first but it actually is very logical and straightforward. Points are earned both during the game and at the very end which allows for various strategies to be successful and keeps the emotions high until the end â€“ that is when the last landscape tile is placed and the player with the highest score is proclaimed the winner.</p>

<h2 id="what-kind-of-vocabulary-can-you-practice">What kind of vocabulary can you practice?</h2>

<p>This game is called The Mind for a reason â€“ it is played in the playersâ€™ minds, they cannot exchange any information about their cards or strategy. This makes it a very exciting, language independent game great for beginners as they can focus entirely on practicing their numbers (read the numbers and levels that appear on the table) and general gaming vocabulary (download the free Useful phrases in Polish PDF).</p>
