I"<p>###Why does it work?</p>

<p>Because it forces you to start speaking. Now. Unprepared. With mistakes. Just say it and move your pawn cause it‚Äôs my turn now and I want to invade your town and get more points! You are learning to use Polish for accomplishing some goals and that is possibly the most important lesson you can get in the early phases of learning a language. If you are interested in learning more about what games do to our learning process,<a href="https://www.google.com">read this article</a>.</p>

<p>###How does it work?</p>

<p>You may wonder how learning how to say <em>I‚Äôm transplanting your brain</em> or <em>I‚Äôve built a castle next to your river</em> can possibly be useful in learning how to communicate in Polish with your parents-in-law ü§î. But wait, didn‚Äôt you say studying grammar was boring‚Åâ So just let it sneak in to your brain while you‚Äôre having fun transplanting brains and building castles. You‚Äôre a perfect structure decoding machine, just let your mind do the job. And <strong>learn words</strong> ‚Äì games create a meaningful context to learn and practice new vocabulary and expressions that you can then use in your everyday communication.</p>

<p>###Take it step by step</p>

<p><strong>Keep your expectations realistic</strong> ‚Äì learning a language takes a lot of time and practice and you will not learn it all by playing 3 games. But each game brings you closer to your goal and offers some new, valuable insights!</p>

<p>###What games to play</p>

<p>Not every game will do the job, they need to meet some requirements to be useful for language learning and for beginners/intermediate learners. But don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm here to help!

<p>###The most important</p>

<p>You just play the game the way it‚Äôs supposed to be played but all the players need to describe out loud what they‚Äôre doing in each move - this is when the magic happens ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú® In my game descriptions you will find examples of phrases you will use during the game <i class="fa fa-2x fa-commenting fa-fw wow bounceIn text-primary" aria-hidden="true"></i> and free downloadable .pdf files with the Polish vocabulary you need for the game and the game instructions in Polish <i class="fa fa-2x fa-download fa-fw wow bounceIn text-primary" aria-hidden="true"></i>.
