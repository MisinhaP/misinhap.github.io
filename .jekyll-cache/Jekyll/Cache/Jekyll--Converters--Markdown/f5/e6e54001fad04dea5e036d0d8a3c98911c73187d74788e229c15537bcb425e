I"<p>Born to be a teacher</p>

<p>I embarked on polish lessions because my son is raised bilingual and my wife is Polish. Within month Monika taught me the basics, most of the rather complicated grammar, and plenty of useful verbs to construct useful sentences. She step-wise introduced me into a complex language at the right pace. Lessons generally contained a good balance between the more dryish grammar rules mixed with playful and creative exercises that are fun. On top of that, she took time to put think I learned into their cultural context, which helped me to understand new information better. Monika is very kind and relaxed, but above all has a tremendous enthusiastic spirit, which greatly helps to motivate you to learn. She is also very ad rem, knowing when to correct your mistakes, so you donâ€™t become sloppy in the end. It is clear that she has a natural way of teaching, and I would definitely recommend her if you seek to master the Polish language, or just want to get acquainted with it.</p>
