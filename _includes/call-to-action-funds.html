 You've been learning the language forever but see no results. The spelling and pronunciation still make no sense to you. You can communicate but often find yourself in awkward social situations, often with your in-laws. You don't want to learn the language but don't know how to say this to your family. You're a parent of a bilingual child and don't know how to help them speak, read and write better. You or your child are dyslexic and you're not sure how to approach this. You were raised bilingual but you're not sure if your Polish is good enough.
