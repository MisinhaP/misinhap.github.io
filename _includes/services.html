                        <h2>Experiential learning and gamification</h2>
                        <p class="text-muted">
I <b>apply games to transform complex educational content into engaging, immersive learning experiences</b> - no more boring grammar coursebooks and starting to talk 'when you're ready'. Games give you an amazing opportunity to role play in new contexts and implement new skills on-the-job, make mistakes in a safe environment, practice, have fun and learn some more. 
<p>So stop wasting your time on learning from books for children or language apps and learn through language puzzles, improvisation and experimenting with alternative communication channels - I’m sure you’ve never tried a language course like this! You are going to love it and you are going to see fast results. And in the moments of doubt I will support you with a <b>learning mentoring session</b> helping you evaluate your learning process and suggesting valuable improvements.</p> </p>
