                        <h2>Experiential learning and gamification!</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>I apply games to transform complex educational content into engaging, immersive learning experiences - no more boring grammar coursebooks and starting to talk 'when you're ready'. Games give you an amazing opportunity to role play in new contexts and implement new skills on-the-job, make mistakes in a safe environment, practice, have fun and learn some more. So stop wasting your time on learning from books for children or language apps and learn with a personalised curriculum playing language puzzles and improvisation games and assisted by a qualified teacher! </p>
