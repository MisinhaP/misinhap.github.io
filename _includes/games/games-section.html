                    <h2>Gamification!</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>I apply games to transform complex educational content into engaging, immersive learning experiences - no more boring grammar coursebooks and starting to talk 'when you're ready'. Games give you an amazing opportunity to role play in new contexts and implement new skills on-the-job, make mistakes in a safe environment, practice, have fun and learn some more. You can already start playing in Polish at home with your Polish family and friends - get the game, download my free instructions and games vocabulary pdfs and... have fun learning!</p>
