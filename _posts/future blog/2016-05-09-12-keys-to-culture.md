Learn their culture!

It helps and makes a huge difference if you understand their culturally based assumptions about human communication and behaviour and speak the same 'language of culture' even if you don't speak good Polish.

Here is a link to a great, online tutorial for business people, teachers, travellers and curious individuals - people who would like to improve their cross-cultural communication skills, learn something about themselves and learn how to cope with the complex expectations of the modern, globalising world.

It's a 1.5 hours on-demand video with full lifetime access (also on mobile and TV) and a Certificate of Completion available now on Udemy. In order to register simply click here.

About the course:

Our experience working with various international companies across Europe proved how challenging it is to run a business for those who struggle to communicate across languages and cultures without any linguistic and cultural-diversity awareness. To fully understand your business partners, customers or employees you need much more than the common language. You have to know their cultural values, communication styles and negotiation patterns to avoid painful faux pas and severe disappointment.
In our course we will provide you with effective strategies for cross-cultural communication and help you understand how specific cultures think, work, interact and manage their time. We will encourage you to rediscover your own culture and look at intercultural communication from a different perspective.
