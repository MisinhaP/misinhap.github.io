<b>Have you ever bought a DIY language learing course that promissed to turn you into a language ninja within a month or a black-belt-level conversation expert within a couple of months? Did it also claim learning will require minimum, if any, effort from your side ‚Äì maybe you could even learn while you're asleep?</b> üòè

If the answer to any of the above questions is yes, I would be interested to know if it worked out for you. But wait, let me hazard a quess...

<b>No, it didn't work!</b> üò≠

Well, the most probable scenario is that you gave up after 3 days discouraged by the fact you actually did have to make some regular effort to see any results and you didn't understand the grammar from Lesson 2 onwards. If it did work though, it means you must have done one or two of the following things ‚Äì because this is how learning a language really works!

<ul>
  <li><b>You learned and practiced regularly</b></li>
<br>
      <p>There is no shortcut to learning a language: you need regular practice and exposure to the language in order to be able to learn it. The more effort you invest, the more results you will see.

      Follow a regular language course to keep getting new input adjusted to your level and ask questions.¬†Every exercise you do should be designed to draw your attention to some specific aspect of the language/culture you are learning or to practice some specific language skill you already have - if you are not sure which one, just ask your teacher!</p>

  <li><b>You made mistakes</b></li>
<br>
      <p>Don't expect yourself to learn everything immediately. This one is really important ‚Äì learning takes time. Allow yourself a lot of space for making mistakes, revising things and approaching the same problem several times. It is much more effective to start using the language immediately and learn from mistakes than to wait until you are able to say everything perfectly.</p>

  <li><b>You were open to discover new things</b></li>
<br>
      <p>It is inevitable to compare new things you are learning with the things you already know. Many things can be expressed differently in various languages and cultures, many things are not expressed at all or, quite the opposite, given extra importance and that's ok. Do compare but be ready to accept the approach to the world that the new language has to offer.</p>

  <li><b>You enjoyed what you were doing</b></li>
<br>

      <p>Simply enjoy and have a good time learning! Learning is a lot of work but it should also be fun and engaging ‚Äì so if you're not enjoying the process, think about changing the level, group, learning method, the teacher or even the language. Always reflect on your motivation; maybe it's simply not your thing and there's nothing wrong about it.</p>
</ul>



Learning any language is complex, time consuming and requires effort, dedication and regular practice. But if you do it right, it can also offer a lot of fun and be a rewarding and life-altering experience. And buying a learn-a-language-in-30-days course can be a great beginning :)
