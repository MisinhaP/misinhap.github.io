<b>What are the psychological benefits of game-based learning? Is learning by playing overrated? Is it only for children? Humans, like other mammals, are designed to learn by playing - getting and practicing new skills in a safe, simulated environment -- and there is some serious scientific research to back it up!</b>


<b>Reality doesn‚Äôt motivate us as effectively</b>


Sometimes finding the motivation to sit down, open the books and focus on studying is hard but it's quite easy to motivate ourselves to have some fun. If you like playing board games, talking, laughing and socialising with other people, you will be looking forward to playing (and learning), <b>you will be more inclined to have a regular and persevering language practice</b> and later be more confident to use the language also talking and socialising with people outside of the gaming context.



<b>A sneering monkey that fell into the void</b>


There is a direct, real and concrete feedback in a game -- as opposed to a grammar exercise book -- you make a mistake, you lose a point, you change your strategy, you win, you learn. <b>The closer the feedback is to the action, the more effective it is, and the faster you learn and adapt</b>. In traditional education errors are often seen in a negative way and cause the motivation to drop, sometimes to the point of constituting a real block. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247503384_Phasic_Emotional_Reactions_to_Video_Game_Events_A_Psychophysiological_Investigation" target="_blank">A Finnish research team found quite the opposite</a> when it comes to playing -- the emotional peak in games does not occur when you exceed a level but when you fail! It is enough to offer a small reward for the player -- in their experiment an animation of a sneering monkey falling into the void did the job üôä 

 

<b>The Amygdala</b>


Playing is emotions and <b>we remember the information learned through emotional learning better.</b> Positive emotions make learning by playing very efficient and the effectiveness of learning depends on our emotional engagement -- the stronger the emotions, the easier the knowledge learned by playing is to remember.

One of the parts of our brain responsible for memory and emotional learning is called <a href="https://www.neuroscientificallychallenged.com/blog/amygdala-beyond-fear" target="_blank">amygdala</a>. It is an intricate structure with manifold connections to other parts of the brain that has come to be considered an important region for the consolidation of memories that have any strong emotional component -- both positive or negative. So emotional learning is hard-wired into our brains. 

  

<b>The abstract and the everyday</b>

The study of language and its structures is very abstract and detatched from an average person's experience of using language. Contrary to what the mainstream education system made us believe, the theoretical study of language is stream-lined for precise expert communication and not for language learning. Even with the help of positive emotions this makes much of the traditional language learning content hard to grasp. <b>Learning by playing connects abstract knowledge and everyday life.</b> Games create a meaningful context to learn and practice the new vocabulary and expressions that we can then use in our everyday communication.  


> abstract knowledge + real manifestations = true understanding

<b>Help me win!</b>


Another important factor is cooperation. In games, there is
always someone to help you accomplish your mission. The success of the video game Word of Warcraft was largely due to this -- it was the first game to introduce mechanisms that generate trust between players. In traditional learning it is seen differently: being ‚Äúaccompanied‚Äù is considered a sign of a specific difficulty of the student. 
And last but not least...


<b>Smarter every game</b>

<a href="https://www.spiel-messe.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Do-Board-games-make-People-Smarter.pdf" target="_blank">In a study</a> by a research team from the University of Perugia the findings relating to fluid intelligence, analytical and converging cognitive processes and creativity were compared. The results suggest that non-random board games can be an important stimulus for cognitive functions and creativity and the results can be observed after as little as 26 hours of training.
