languagelevel: This is the language fluency level you need in order to be able to start playing; it depends on the number of words you need to know and the complexity of phrases you will build during the game.

vocabulary: Each game has some background story that sets up the language environment for the players -- you will be talking about holidays, medieval towns, art, birds, pandas or counting money or points. This is the vocabulary you'll be learning while playing. 

gametype: Games can have different formats and use various game mechanics and we all have our preferences :) Maybe you like playing a certain type of games or would not like to repeat the genre and try something new each time? 

gamelevel: This tells you how much time and brain power you need to invest to learn the rules of the game itself before you start playing. I focus on games that are easy to learn to save your precious resources for language learning!

numberplayers: Most board games on the market are designed for 2-4/5 players. Sometimes the game mechanics does not work optimally with too small/big crowds, I'll let you know if a game doesn't scale well, especially for couples! 

gametime: The time it takes to play depends on the number of players, the complexity of its mechanics, players' understanding of the rules and pure luck if it is a thing in a given game.

description: You may wonder how learning how to say <i>I'm transplanting your brain</i> or <i>I've built a castle next to your river</i> can possibly be useful in learning how to communicate in Polish with your parents-in-law. But wait, haven't you just said studying grammar was boring‚Åâ

## What is the game about?

**My game descriptions are not typical game reviews** with in-deepth rule details and my personal rating -- you can find plenty of these on numerous websites produced by real gaming professionals. But I like to give you some information about the way the game is played so that you can make more informed choices when selecting your next game -- that's what you'll find in this section.


## What kind of vocabulary can you practice?

As a professional linguist, in my reviews I focus on the vocabulary and structures you can expect to learn in each game. Not every game will do the job, they need to meet some requirements to be useful for language learning -- especially for beginners/intermediate learners and when you cannot get the target language edition but need to be content with what you can find on the local market.
But don't worry, I'm here to help! I hand-picked some games that are both fun to play and can teach you a variety of language skills. I only post about games that are usually rated high by my students and that I pre-selected as noteworthy -- in this section I will explain you why.

<p><i class="fa fa-2x fa-download fa-fw wow bounceIn text-primary" aria-hidden="true"></i>&nbsp; Free downloads available for this game: </p>

I mainly choose games that don't use a lot of text directly on the cards/board so that you can buy any language edition available where you live and then just play it in Polish -- for your convenience I attach a free downloadable pdf with instructions in Polish 
<i class="fa fa-2x fa-map fa-fw wow bounceIn text-primary" aria-hidden="true"></i>
so that you have a great resource to find all the words needed to play!
And especially for beginners, I have created a list of commonly used phrases for playing board & card games
