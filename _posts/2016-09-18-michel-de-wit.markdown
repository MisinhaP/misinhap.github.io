It enables me to talk a lot better in Polish, without people making fun of me…:-) Courses driven by Monika are the perfect combination of hard work, but with (a lot of) fun as well. Learning by doing, not by filling the tank with tons of words only. I truly recommend Monika if you want to learn a language in an efficient and fun way!"

LEARNING CAN BE FUN

During 2017 I participated the Polish classes of Monika, organised by Lokomotywa. In just a few months she taught me the basics of grammar and a lot of verbs. It enables me to talk a lot better in Polish, without people making fun of me…:-) Courses driven by Monika are the perfect combination of hard work, but with (a lot of) fun as well. Learning by doing, not by filling the tank with tons of words only. I truly recommend Monika if you want to learn a language in an efficient and fun way!
