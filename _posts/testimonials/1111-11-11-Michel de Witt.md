testimonial1: "I participated the Polish classes of Monika; in just a few months she taught me the basics of grammar and a lot of verbs. It enables me to talk a lot better in Polish, without people making fun of meâ€¦:-) Courses driven by Monika are the perfect combination of hard work, but with (a lot of) fun as well. Learning by doing, not by filling the tank with tons"

testimonial2: "of words only. I truly recommend Monika if you want to learn a language in an usualy difficult Polish grammar! I was very skeptical about anyone being able to explain to me  efficient and fun way!"
