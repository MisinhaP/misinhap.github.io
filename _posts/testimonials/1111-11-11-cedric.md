testimonial1: "Monika is a great teacher and an easy person to talk to. I was having classes of Polish with her and I felt that I made a huge progress in my knowledge. She was not only able to explain the language to me but capable of discussing it and its roots (which for me made the classes much more interesting). I definitely recommend her and I bet you will be a better speaker in the end."
