testimonial1: "I enoyed my Polish lessons with Monika very much. She has a great teaching approach. Monika can explain the most difficult topis in a comprehensive way and make them easy to remember. She quickly gets you over the reservation to actually speak Polish and within a few months time I went from understanding a few words to following conversations and participating in them. Monika"

testimonial2: "is not only a patient teacher but also makes the lessons fun. I absolutely recommend working with her."
