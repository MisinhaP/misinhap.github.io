## What is the game about?

Collecting as little cards/points as possible. Each player starts with ten cards in their hands and they get rid of them one by one by placing them in four rows displayed on the table according to the following rules:
1) Your card has to be higher than the last card in a given row but lower than the first card in the next row.
2) If you play the 6th card in the row, you need to collect the other five cards and get the penalty points they have (the bull heads on the card, not the number!)
3) If your card is the lowest number that can be played, you choose the row to collect (with any number of cards in it, possibly with the lowest count of bull heads) and your lowest card becomes the start of a new row.

This simple mechanics makes people addicted. You'll want to play again and again to see if you can make it better next time. And once your mind gets used to strategising for the lowest number of points, switch the rules and play to get the most bull heads and physically (really!) feel how it rewires the neurons in your head, mindblowing.

This game has been published under two names: Take 5! or 6 nimmt! There are also a few sequels that build up on the basic rules published as Take a number! or X nimmt!, Hornochsen and, the latest in the family, 11 nimmt!.

## What kind of vocabulary can you practice?

We are, of course, after adding more neuronal action to each game by playing it in a foreign language - this one will keep you busy pronouncing all the numbers you see in the row where you play your card. Let the native speakers guide you in your pronounciation and you'll soon be able to perfectly count from 1 to 104.
