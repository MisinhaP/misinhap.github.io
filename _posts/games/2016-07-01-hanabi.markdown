## What is the game about?

Hanabi is a cooperative game in which all the players prepare a spectacular fireworks show designed in 5 different colors -- and each color needs to be arranged in the ascending 1-2-3-4-5 sequence. The trick? Players cannot see their own hand cards and need the advice of their fellow players! <br>

In each turn you can either play/discard a card or hint another player about the cards they have or do not have -- you do this by choosing either a colour or a number and a) pointing to all their cards that share the chosen characteristic or b) informing them they do not have such cards. Based on the hints they get, players start new fireworks or extend the ones already started on the table following the 1-2-3-4-5 sequence. The more cards the players play correctly, the more points they receive when the game ends. The game can be extended with the colorful fireworks cards and the spare note tokens.

## What kind of vocabulary can you practice?

You can practice 5 colours, *white, blue, green, yellow, red*, and 5 numeral nouns (not numbers!) which are the equivalent of the English *a one, a two, a three, a four, a five*. This seems to be quite a limited amount of vocabulary to practice, however, you have to use it in sentences and this is where it gets challenging as you can choose to use it in *3 different cases* ! The native speakers at the table will do this automatically, just follow them and you'll be all right ðŸ˜…
