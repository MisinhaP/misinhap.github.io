description: An interactive Asian themed labirynth that can entertain a group of 8 - at least before you collide with another player and get eliminated. But worry not, you'll only have a few minutes to fetch another drink before the next round begins and you can give these winding lines another try.

## What is the game about?

Tsuro is a very easy to learn game of laying down tiles on the board and having dragons follow these lines without colliding with other players' dragons or getting off the board - both scenarios mean you loose and get out of the game until the next one. When it comes to the rules, that's really all you need to know!!
So besides being purely spaciovisual and completly language independent, it is also one in which gaming novices can meaningfully play against experts as it's half strategy and half luck. Made for groups as big as 8, it makes a perfectly safe choice for any, not only linguistacly diverse, crowd.

And last but not least, it is beautifully and elegantly published, a delight for your eyes in 3 variants - the original Tsuro alongside Tsuro of the Seas and Tsuro Phoenix Rising which, except for captivating graphics and fancy checkers, also offer extended rules with sea monsters lurking in the dark waters and star tokens helping you earn more points.
