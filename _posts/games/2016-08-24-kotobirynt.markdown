## What is the game about?

Your mission is to bring home as many sweet, hungry kitties as possible -- preferably those which give you the most points ðŸ˜¸. You form a square consisting of 4x4 labirynth tiles and place 2 cat cards and 2 home cards outside of the square (the instruction specifies where exactly!). The players take turns to rotate and/or exchange the labirynth tiles in order to create a path without obstacles between a cat and a home where it can get a yummy meal. If a player can bring a kitty home in 2 moves, they win the cat card and the corresponding points. The game stops as soon as all cat cards have been won. The player (1-4) or team (2 vs. 2) with the highest number of points wins.

## What kind of vocabulary can you practice?

This game is completly language independent as the main strategy used is visuospacial -- you need to visually coordinate 16 tiles to navigate the cat's way out of the maze. This calls for a lot of **directions giving** and this is exactly what the game helps you practice - *turn right/left, go up/down the sewer, pass below/above the bridge*, etc. <br> You can play in the basic variant narrating your actions in the present indicative tense, e.g. *I'm turning right and going up under the tunnel.*, or play in the imperative mode giving directions to your team mate if you play 2 against 2, e.g. *Go left, pass by the mouse and continue up.*
