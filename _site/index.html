                            <p>Monika is a great teacher and an easy person to talk to. I was having classes of Polish with her and I felt that I made a huge progress in my knowledge. She was not only able to explain the language to me but capable of discussing it and its roots (which for me made the classes much more interesting). I definitely recommend her and I bet you will be a better speaker in the end.

It enables me to talk a lot better in Polish, without people making fun of me…:-) Courses driven by Monika are the perfect combination of hard work, but with (a lot of) fun as well. Learning by doing, not by filling the <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> tank with tons of words only. I truly recommend Monika if you want to learn a language in an usly difficult Polish grammar! I was very skeptical about anyone being able to explain to me  efficient and fun way! </span> <a onclick="myFunction()" id="readmore">Read more</a>

                            <p>After living already a few years in Poland as a Dutch speaker and being able to say a good few words in Polish , which in all honesty i would just randomly put together in a sentence without any regard to form or linguistic rules, i decided it was time to tackle the oh so famously difficult Polish grammar! I was very skeptical about anyone being able to explain to me <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> the Polish case system as many of my polish friends had tried and given up , among them someone who has a doctorate in Polish philology. In my first meeting with Monika which lasted about an hour she took away every shred of my skepticism. With a very smart analogy she was able to explain to me the reason and sense of the case system and gave me the confidence to proceed to try to unravel this mysterious grammar. We had classes together for the better part of a year and my Polish has improved immensely in this time. If she would have stayed in Poland i would have continued my classes and would probably be writing this in Polish. She is a very dedicated and enthusiastic person and if there is something as a “gift to teach” than she has it. If you are looking to learn a new language and really want to get the best out of your time and money then don’t hesitate and go for it! You won’t regret it!</span>                     <a onclick="myFunction()" id="readmore">Read more</a>

                            <p>I embarked on Polish lessions because my son is raised bilingual and my wife is Polish. Within month Monika taught me the basics, most of the rather complicated grammar, and plenty of useful verbs to construct useful sentences. She step-wise introduced me into a complex language at the right pace. Lessons generally contained a good balance between the more dryish grammar <span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2"> rules mixed with playful and creative exercises that are fun. On top of that, she took time to put things I learned into their cultural context, which helped me to understand new information better. Monika is very kind and relaxed, but above all has a tremendous enthusiastic spirit, which greatly helps to motivate you to learn. She is also very ad rem, knowing when to correct your mistakes, so you don’t become sloppy in the end. It is clear that she has a natural way of teaching, and I would definitely recommend her if you seek to master the Polish language, or just want to get acquainted with it.</span>                     <a onclick="myFunction()" id="readmore2">Read more</a>
